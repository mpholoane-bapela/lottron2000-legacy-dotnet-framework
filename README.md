# Lottron2000 – Legacy .NET Framework Lottery Simulation System (EF6, SQL Server)

Lottron2000 is a **legacy .NET Framework 4.8 lottery simulation system** built using **C#**, **Entity Framework 6**, and **SQL Server**.  
It represents a **real-world, enterprise, monolithic, pre-.NET Core application** originally developed around **2013**.

This repository is preserved for **educational and architectural analysis**, with a focus on **legacy system design, technical debt, refactoring strategy, and modernization planning**.

## 🚨 Project Disclaimer (Read Before Cloning)

- ❌ The solution **will not build successfully**
- ❌ The **SQL Server database is not included**
- ❌ Entity Framework connection strings reference a **non-existent local machine**
- ❌ This project is **not production-ready**
- ❌ No setup, configuration, or installation support is provided

This repository is **not intended to be executed** without significant reconstruction.

## 🎯 Project Purpose & Learning Goals

This project exists to:

- Preserve a **real-world legacy .NET Framework codebase**
- Demonstrate **enterprise-style layered architecture**
- Serve as a reference for **codebase analysis and refactoring**
- Highlight common **pre-.NET Core design patterns**
- Support learning around **technical debt and modernization planning**
- Compare legacy systems with **modern .NET (6 / 7 / 8)** practices

---

## 📌 Project Status

- 🧊 **Frozen legacy codebase**
- 🚫 **No active development**
- 🧪 **Educational / reference only**

A modern rewrite may exist in a separate repository.

## 🏗️ Solution Architecture Overview

The solution follows a **traditional multi-project, layered architecture** typical of older **enterprise .NET Framework applications**.

### Solution Structure

## 🧩 Project Breakdown (Multi-Project .NET Solution)

### Lottron2000.BusinessLogic

Core business logic including:

* Lottery number generation
* Simulated draws
* Winning prize calculations
* Playing session workflows

---

### Lottron2000.Data

Data access layer built with **Entity Framework 6**:

* Database context configuration
* Repository-style data access
* Checksum handling
* SQL Server dependencies (not included)

---

### Lottron2000.Models

Shared domain models and entity definitions used across the solution.

---

### Lottron2000.UnitTests

Unit testing project containing:

* Lottery number generation tests
* Simulated draw validation
* Prize calculation tests
* Legacy `App.config` with EF configuration

> ⚠️ Unit tests **cannot run** due to missing database dependencies.

---

### Data Extraction Projects

* `Lottron2000.DataExtraction`
* `Lottron2000.DataExtraction.ConsoleApps`

Used for:

* Lottery data extraction
* Console-based data processing utilities

---

### IntegrationProfilingTests

Contains:

* Integration-style tests
* Performance and profiling experiments

---

## 🗄️ Database & Entity Framework Configuration

* **Database:** SQL Server
* **ORM:** Entity Framework 6
* **Database schema:** ❌ Not included
* **Migrations:** ❌ Not included
* **Connection strings:** Reference a legacy local machine (`ebapela-pc`)

All database-related assets have been **intentionally excluded** from source control.

---

## ❓ Why the Solution Does Not Compile (Missing Database)

The solution does not compile because:

* The required SQL Server database schema is missing
* Entity Framework connection strings reference a non-existent environment
* Certain legacy dependencies are no longer available
* The codebase has not been modernized for current tooling

This behavior is **intentional**.
